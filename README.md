How to debug using mulitplayer. Go into the assets folder then open the scenes folder. Double click scene 1 to open it in unity editor.
At the top of the screen click on the files tab, then select build settings. In the menue make sure scene 1 and scene 2 are in the small window if you dont see them you can click and drag them from the scene folder.
Then click on the build button. This will open your project file create a new folder called builds and then another folder inside that called debug select the debug folder. This will build a test version of the game in this folder.
Next go to the unity editor where scene 1 is. Hit CTRL B this will run the test build from the folder we just made. When the build is running it should be in a small window.
Go back to the unity editor make sure scene 1 is active NOT SCENE 2 and hit the play button. This will run the game in unity.
